# ü§î Problem Space

### Problems to Solve/Requirements to Create

Horizone is an AI-powered hotel booking platform that allows users to input their preferences and receive personalized hotel recommendations. The challenges faced include ensuring fast and seamless user interactions, maintaining real-time hotel data, implementing effective AI-driven recommendations, and securing user information throughout the booking process.

### üëâ **Problem: Slow AI-Based Recommendations**

#### **Problem Statement:**

Generating personalized hotel recommendations using AI can be slow, especially when processing a large number of user preferences and hotel options. This delay in fetching results can cause user frustration and lower engagement.

#### **Current Solution:**

We integrated **OpenAI's GPT-4o** to generate personalized hotel recommendations based on user preferences. To speed up the process, we use **pre-calculated recommendation caching** for frequently requested preferences and **batch processing** for high-demand search results.

#### **How do we know it is a problem:**

- **User feedback:** Users report delays when receiving hotel recommendations based on their input.

- **Metrics:** Increased abandonment rates after submitting preferences.

- **Evidence:** Performance logs show long processing times when AI is involved in fetching hotel recommendations.

### üëâ **Problem: Complex User Authentication and Authorization**

#### **Problem Statement:**

Managing user authentication and secure access to personalized features, such as booking history, payments, and preferences, is critical for a seamless experience. Poorly managed authentication can cause issues with session expiration or user data leakage.

#### **Current Solution:**

We use **Clerk** for authentication, ensuring secure login and session management. Additionally, **role-based access control** (RBAC) ensures only authorized users can access certain features.

#### **How do we know it is a problem:**

- **User feedback:** Users report problems accessing personalized features after logging in.

- **Metrics:** Increased logout rates and failed attempts to access restricted pages.

- **Evidence:** Logs indicate frequent session expiration and failed authentications on user profile pages.

### **Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)**:

The frontend is responsible for providing an interactive user interface for the hotel booking process. Users can browse hotels, input their preferences, and view personalized recommendations. React.js ensures efficient rendering of the UI, while Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design that adapts to various screen sizes. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls to fetch hotel data, recommendations, and booking information.

### **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**:

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, handling the logic for searching hotels, processing user preferences, managing bookings, and communicating with the AI recommendation system. The backend exposes RESTful APIs that allow the frontend to interact with the hotel data, user profiles, and booking functionalities. Express.js is used for routing, middleware management, and efficient error handling, while Node.js provides a scalable server-side environment for processing requests.

### **Database (MongoDB)**:

MongoDB is used to store dynamic and evolving data such as user profiles, hotel details, booking history, and preferences. Its NoSQL structure is ideal for handling various types of data that can change over time (e.g., new hotels, changing availability). The flexibility of MongoDB allows Horizone to scale effectively while providing fast read and write operations, crucial for managing the real-time nature of a hotel booking platform.

### **AI Integration (OpenAI GPT-4o)**:

OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o is integrated into the backend to provide personalized hotel recommendations based on user preferences, such as location, budget. The AI processes user input and generates tailored suggestions to help users make more informed decisions. By leveraging GPT-4o‚Äôs natural language processing capabilities, the system can handle complex user queries, providing a smooth, interactive experience for users searching for hotels.
